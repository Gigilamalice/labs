# Policies

In ACM, policies are composed by different components, we are going to explore these components.

**Policy**

Defines the different "checks" clusters will be validated against. `Policies` have `Specifications`. A Specification is a set of rules that will be validated against the clusters.

**PlacementBinding**

Similar to `RoleBindings`, it ensures which `Policies` are assigned to which `Clusters`. In order to do so `PlacementRules` are put into the mix.
